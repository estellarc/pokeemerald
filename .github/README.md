# Pathfinder 1.1.0

## About

This is a complete reimplementation of [Juanjo's old path finder](https://www.pokecommunity.com/threads/applymovement-vs-a-algorithm-for-pathfinding.445293/) for [`pokeemerald-expansion`](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion) `1.13.0+`.
This branch adds the `moveobjecttocoords` and `approachobject` scripting macros, for generating movement scripts at run time, achieved by using the Weighted A* Algorithm. This branch aims to give romhackers an easier way to create more complex movement scripts and reduce branching.

## Usage

### `moveobjecttocoords`
```gas
moveobjecttocoords localId:req, x:req, y:req, facingDirection:req, speed=1, maxnodes=256
```

- `facingDirection`, it controls the facing direction. If it is `DIR_NONE`, the facing direction will depend on the generated script.
- `speed`, it controls the movement speed and goes from 0 to 4. 0 is slow, 1 is normal, and so on.
- `maxnodes`, it controls how many nodes can be generated (aka, how many tiles can be checked).

### `approachobject`
```gas
approachobject localId:req, targetLocalId:req, facingDirection:req, approachDirection:req, speed=1, maxnodes=256
```
Same as `moveobjecttocoords`, but keep in mind that `approachDirection` does not support `DIR_NONE`.

### What happens if there is no path?

The system will display an X icon, if it's unable to find a valid path.

> [!WARNING]
If there is no path, it will most likely lag the game.
Try to only use the macro when you are sure there is a valid path.

### For expanded Metatile count users:
Set `PATH_FINDER_MAX_ELEVATION` to `MAX_ELEVATION_LEVEL`, otherwise elevation handling won't work correctly.

## Why Weighted A*?

This variant of the A* algorithm provides better performance for searching the first valid path. This done by giving more priority to nodes more close to the goal.

### A* vs Weighted A*

| A* Algorithm  | Weighted A* Algorithm  |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| ![a_star](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3fa2ccc-4074-40da-b03d-d64ccfe83d9e) | ![weighted_a_star](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e127af4b-447a-45f2-9ec0-c5aab8965fd7) |

However Weighted A* can generate less natural-looking paths than regual A*, and it can be tricked more easly by mazes, but it provides better performance in most cases, since it requires less nodes to find a valid path.
