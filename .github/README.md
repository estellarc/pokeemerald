# Pathfinder 1.0.1

## About

This is a complete reimplementation of [Juanjo's old path finder](https://www.pokecommunity.com/threads/applymovement-vs-a-algorithm-for-pathfinding.445293/) for [`pokeemerald-expansion`](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion) `1.13.0+`.
This branch adds the `moveobjecttocoords` scripting macro, for generating movement scripts at run time, achieved by using the Weighted A* Algorithm. This branch aims to give romhackers an easier way to create more complex movement scripts and reduce branching.

## Usage

```gas
moveobjecttocoords localId:req, x:req, y:req, facing:req, speed=1, maxnodes=256
```

- `facing`, facing controls the facing direction. If it is `DIR_NONE`, the facing direction will depend on the generated script.
- `speed`, controls the movement speed and goes from 0 to 4. 0 is slow, 1 is normal, and so on.
- `maxnodes`, controls how many nodes can be generated (aka, how many tiles can be checked).

### What happens if there is no path?

The system will display a X icon, if it is unable to find a path.

> [!WARNING]
If there is no path, it will most likely lag the game.
Try to use the macro only when you are sure there is a valid path.

### For expanded Metatile count users
Set `PATH_FINDER_MAX_ELEVATION` to `MAX_ELEVATION`, otherwise elevation handling won't work correctly.

## Why Weighted A*?

This variant of the A* algorithm provides better performance for searching the first valid path. This done by giving more priority to nodes more close to the goal.

### A* vs Weighted A*

| A* Algorithm  | Weighted A* Algorithm  |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| ![a_star](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31d3dbb6-f10a-44f8-bc30-65854f7d48b4) | ![weighted_a_star](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aadd4d75-7a63-4055-a805-5d231e7f4210) |

However Weighted A* can generate less natural-looking paths, and it can be tricked more easly by mazes, but it provides better performance in most cases.
